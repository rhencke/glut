Go bindings for GLUT: https://github.com/rhencke/Go-GLUT

Requires: https://github.com/banthar/gl

When installing Go-OpenGL, please use:
    gomake install
(just gomake will attempt to compile the Go-OpenGL examples, which require SDL)

If you are using Linux, please ensure you have installed GLUT or freeglut.

To install Go-GLUT:
    gomake install

To compile examples:
    cd examples
    gomake

Known problems:
    Some GLUT functionality (notably, entering game mode on Mac OS X) may cause your program to crash.
